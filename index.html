                    Jawa is an active, obedient and affectionate little dog that is ideal as a family pet. She is friendly with other animals and strangers. Jawa is really smart and enjoys challenges such as picking up her toy balls to keep her engaged, so youâ€™ll have lots of fun teaching her training tricks. Jawa is one very loyal companion and this is one of the hardest decision I have to make because I'm moving in to an apartment that is not pet-friendly.
